Description: RNA-seq workflow for differential transcript usage (DTU) following
             Salmon quantification. This workflow uses Bioconductor packages
	     tximport, DRIMSeq, and DEXSeq to perform a DTU analysis
	     on simulated data. It also shows how to use stageR to perform
	     two-stage testing of DTU, a statistical framework to screen
	     at the gene level and then confirm which transcripts within
	     the significant genes show evidence of DTU.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0),
         DRIMSeq,
	 DEXSeq,
	 stageR,
	 DESeq2,
	 edgeR,
	 rafalib,
	 devtools
